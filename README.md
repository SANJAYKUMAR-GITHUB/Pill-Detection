# Pill-Detection
It offers an inclusive solution to empower visually impaired individuals in effectively managing their medication. Leveraging a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV image processing techniques, our system focuses on the detection and recognition of pills, doctor's prescriptions, and blister packs. We have meticulously curated and pre-processed a diverse collection of pill images to train our CNN model, which excels at accurately classifying and identifying a wide range of pill types. Users can easily interact with our system by capturing images through a camera or input device. The system swiftly processes these images, providing real-time audio feedback by vocalizing the pill's class and reading the Doctor's handwritten prescription medicine name and will read the blister card name using OCR.
